# Master_Codes
All the codes developed in MatLab for my Master. I developed a multiple degree of freedom system representing a bladed disk, tuned and mistuned to suppress vibrations, single and multiple modes with a representing piezoelectric force.
> RUN Model1_blahblah.m and Model2_blahblah.m, the rest are companion codes. The MasterThesis.pdf is also in the repository if you want to understand the Models.
